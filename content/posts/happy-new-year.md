# New Year, New Projects

I'm ringing in 2025 with a pretty large goal. I plan on creating a framework for managing projects at work. I am often asked to lead initiatives on my team. My professional goal this year is to learn more skills related to project management. The point is to lead these initiatives more effectively. I plan to achieve this by managing multiple projects of my own outside of work. This will allow me more freedom to explore approaches, learning how different approaches to different projects might be necessary, and creating a generalized framework of tools and templates I can use at work to guide these initiatives from inception to fruition. 

Thanks for taking a moment. Happy new year! Whoever you are, you're reading this thing I wrote. For that alone I appreciate you more than you know. I hope to publish more content for you soon.

Stay up.
