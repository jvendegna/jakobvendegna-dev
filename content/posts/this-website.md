Okay, so I'm trying to learn project management this year in an effort to be just a little better at organizing and driving my team's initiatives forward. And I learn best by doing. So this year I'm doing a series of projects 

The project I decided to start with is the website you're looking at right now. I've been comfortably employed for a few years now, maybe a little too comfortable. I'll admit the company I work for truly does respect and take care of their employees. But layoffs happen. I have not been affected by this in 3 years and after a string of about 4 years of getting laid off approximately every 6 months, I just decided out of caution that I should spruce up my old dusty website. It's a simple project that will help me cross something off my list and contribute to my project management project.

My old site was terribly designed, but I did it all myself. I centered a div! It has served me well enough. Providing links to the linkedin and having my resume freely downloadable really helped line things up with recruiters, who generally move fast. But it really wasn't aging well. And then one day a thing happened. I knew it was coming, I just didn't care enough to do anything about it. I was hosting on google domains, they sold to squarespace or something, and I failed to update my nameservers, thus the site became inaccessible. I knew it was down before I ever even tried to check. When I did, it was confirmed. I could have logged in and updated them, I just didn't care enough to. I'm too comfortable... 

So here we are, rather than update my nameservers now, I'll just take a moment to flesh out a quick redesign while managing the project as well. It's not easy to not just do every step without checking back in with myself. I probably need to involve someone else in other projects if I hope to gain anything from this wider experience. Lucky for me, I know just the bighaired squee (you know who you are).
