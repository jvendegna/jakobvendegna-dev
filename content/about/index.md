# Hi There! 

I'm Jakob, an infrastructure platform engineer, musician, and dog dude. I currently work in the Identity Security industry at SailPoint. My team manages database infrastructure operations.

Outside of work I have a wife and two dogs, both girls. My girls are what my life revolves around. I work hard so that I can give them the life they deserve and try to live up to being the person they think I am every day.

My hobbies tend to revolve around music. I have an extensive record collection of things I like, I'm not out there treasure hunting. I play music, I've dabbled in a lot of instruments, I "can play" any of them and technically speaking, probably none of them. But I mess with audio production, DAWless mostly. I like pedals and weird instruments, noise, and syncopation. I want to take ugly sounds that you don't like and mash them together to make something you do, that's evocative, and strives to be original. Get at me, I'll forward you some links. 

I also like fishing. I live near some salt flats and fish for red drum, catfish, sheepshead, and bass (fresh and saltwater) year round, I catch a lot of other things. Weird things like lizzard fish, bluefish, and sometimes I get lucky and pull in a mackarell. I have opinions about fishing, but this is a technical blog. Again, ask me about them directly if you're interested.

I have a rather large family I don't get to see as often as I'd like. We're 'globally distributed' so it's not easy.

That's me in a nutshell.
