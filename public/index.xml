      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn project management this year in an effort to be just a little better at organizing and driving my team&amp;rsquo;s initiatives forward. And I learn best by doing. So this year I&amp;rsquo;m doing a series of projects&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The project I decided to start with is the website you&amp;rsquo;re looking at right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve been comfortably employed for a few years now, maybe a little too comfortable. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit the company I work for truly does respect and take care of their employees. But layoffs happen. I have not been affected by this in 3 years and after a string of about 4 years of getting laid off approximately every 6 months, I just decided out of caution that I should spruce up my old dusty website. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple project that will help me cross something off my list and contribute to my project management project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-year-new-projects&#34;&gt;New Year, New Projects&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m ringing in 2025 with a pretty large goal. I plan on creating a framework for managing projects at work. I am often asked to lead initiatives on my team. My professional goal this year is to learn more skills related to project management. The point is to lead these initiatives more effectively. I plan to achieve this by managing multiple projects of my own outside of work. This will allow me more freedom to explore approaches, learning how different approaches to different projects might be necessary, and creating a generalized framework of tools and templates I can use at work to guide these initiatives from inception to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hi-there&#34;&gt;Hi There!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Jakob, an infrastructure platform engineer, musician, and dog dude. I currently work in the Identity Security industry at SailPoint. My team manages database infrastructure operations. The thought that the wrong person could lose access to the wrong system at the wrong time keeps me up at night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of work I have a wife and two dogs, both girls. All my girls is what my life revolves around. I work hard so that I can give them the life they deserve and try to live up to being the person they think I am, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
